# Messenger DataBase Design
## Overview
The primary goal of this project is to familiarize ourselves with the process of database-side development and implement a simple web app in the form of a messaging platform, similar to popular platforms like Telegram. However, in this project, the focus is mainly on the database aspect, while other components are implemented at a minimal and very basic level.

## Database Design Includes the Following:
### User Account
A user is one of the main elements of our messaging platform. Each user must have an account to log in, which contains their personal information. This information includes the user's first name, last name, unique phone number, unique username, and more.

### Contact List
Each user has a contact list to make it easier to view or initiate chats.

### Chat
Any user who wants to communicate with another user must create a chat for this interaction. Each chat is specific to two users in the system, and for more than two participants, a group must be created, which will be discussed later. Two users can only have one chat with each other. It's worth noting that a chat includes a number of messages.

### Message
A series of messages are exchanged between any two users in the system. These messages include attributes to specify which chat they belong to and other details. Note that messages can also be related to a group; to manage them, you can use sender and receiver attributes or create a separate relationship, such as a separate table.

### Group Chat
Group chat is a feature that allows users to create a group and share their messages and announcements. Each group can have multiple members, and group members can share different text messages with each other.

### SpecialQueries
in the (Model\Advanced_Queries\SpecialQueries.sql) dir

## Technologies Utilized

- **Python**: Core programming language used for backend logic and application development.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application and ensuring portability across different environments.
- **SQL**: Used for designing, querying, and managing the relational database.
- **FastAPI**: For building the web API to handle user interactions and data exchange.
- **Uvicorn**: ASGI server for running the FastAPI application.
- **Postman**: For testing and validating API endpoints, ensuring the functionality and performance of the backend.


## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
